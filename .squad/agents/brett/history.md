# Project Context

- **Owner:** briandenicola (Brian)
- **Project:** agent-boundary-lab — a demo proving that outbound network containment for an
  AI agent is enforced by the **Microsoft Foundry platform**, not by application code. A
  Python Google ADK agent with exactly two HTTP tools runs in a Foundry hosted-agent
  container. One tool calls an allowlisted hostname (expected success); the other calls a
  hostname deliberately omitted from the allowlist (expected platform denial). The same
  image digest is deployed twice, and the Audit vs Enforced RAI network egress policy is
  the **only** experimental variable.
- **Stack:** Python 3.12 (uv — **pip cannot install this project**), Google ADK 2.11,
  Terraform with the azapi provider for preview Foundry resources, Azure Foundry hosted
  agents, AKS, Container Apps, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Dapr Workflow (Phases 8–9),
  pytest, go-task. Region canadacentral. Model gpt-5.4-mini.
- **Created:** 2026-10-08

## Core Context

Non-negotiable project rules (from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — violating any of
these invalidates the demo):

- Both tools are **always registered**, in every mode. No conditional registration, no
  code-level hostname allowlist, no prompt-only refusal, no mode-specific branching.
- No arbitrary-URL tools. Destinations come from validated startup config.
- Never present an application check as platform enforcement. A bare HTTP 403, DNS error,
  timeout, model refusal, or missing log is **not** proof of containment. Classify HTTP /
  TLS / DNS / timeout failures separately. **Missing evidence is inconclusive, never a pass.**
- Do not invent SDK APIs, platform field names, or monitoring tables. Verify against
  primary references and record the access date. Preview feature unavailable → mark
  **blocked** and stop.
- Approval gate: generate code, tests, and deployment artifacts freely; get Brian's
  approval before creating billable resources, changing Azure policies, publishing images,
  or sending telemetry somewhere new.
- HTTP hygiene: TLS verification always on, explicit bounded timeouts, redirects disabled,
  no fallback destination.
- Synthetic data only. Label local runs as functional tests, not containment proof.

Brian's standing preferences:

- **He runs every `task` command himself.** Read-only `az` queries are fine. Never apply
  Terraform or create billable resources.
- **No `az` CLI in anything that ships.** Terraform or SDK only — that is what the client
  uses.
- Short, plain, actionable output. No hedging, no unsolicited caveats, no long recaps.
- Commit and push completed work after each feature.

## Current state (2026-10-08)

Deployed and working in canadacentral: Foundry account (inbound-private), AKS, ACR,
Postgres, both Container Apps serving real images, both RAI policies live and correct.
80 unit tests pass. Agent image built and digest known.

**Nothing is enforced yet — no agent version exists**, so neither policy is attached to
anything. That is the active blocker. See `docs/egress-control.md` for the full mechanism
and `docs/compatibility.md` §B9 for the deployment API.
